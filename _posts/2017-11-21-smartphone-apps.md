# Smartphone Apps

![Smartphone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcofromsicily/blog/master/images/smartphone.jpg)

"Smartphone apps" is my collection of useful smartphone applications for people living in Italy.

I advice to dedicate a screen of your smartphone to each of the category of apps listed in the content section, so you can keep your life in order just using your smartphone.

This quick guide was inspired by [Awesome Linux](https://github.com/madbob/awesome-linux-dev).
